# Custom-Pong
Custom Pong game made in JAVA.

Custom feature of it, is that when either player reaches a score of 5, a second ball is added to field for 1 round.

The amount of balls added can be easily modified, by changing `BALL_AMOUNT` variable.

# How to launch?
  Open .jar file.

# Currently known bugs:
- Sometimes multiple balls spawn at the same location and clip into one another , creating illusion of only 1 ball. (Or maybe this is a feature?)

# Future updates
- Add menu
- Add settings
- Add music
